        <p class="text-muted">Our Parish motto is â€œGrowing Together and through working in partnership with families
          and the parish in the spirit of the gospels we provide our students purposeful learning and life experiences
          within contemporary learning spaces.

          We promote and value academic excellence and provide a balanced personalised curriculum with a strong focus on
          student wellbeing. Being part of a caring faith community instils our students with a sense of identity and a
          feeling of belonging.

          St Mark's staff are committed to providing a high quality curriculum that challenges students. The teaching is
          targeted to engage students in their learning within flexible groupings and focuses on empowering students
          under the guidance of the teacher to monitor and assess their own learning through reflection and self
          evaluation.

          The teachers are also engaged in high quality professional development and work together collaboratively to
          create the environment to allow students to make a difference for themselves.

          All learning areas throughout the school have been refurbished and updated to provide a cohesive learning
          environment from Foundation (Prep) to Year 6. Our learning spaces accommodate areas that are suitable for
          whole class, collaborative, small group and individual learning. We have a purpose built resource centre which
          incorporates a library, inquiry & STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) space where students
          can participate in coding and technology and science activities, art room and cooking facilities, multimedia
          facilities and a seminar room.

          Specialist subjects are Physical Education, Performing Arts (incorporating drama, dance, music), Japanese Art,
          Inquiry / STEM, Technology / Coding (accredited eSmart school).

          Students are also provided with opportunities to participate in a range of extracurricular activities such as
          Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden, coding club, choir, lunchtime games club, piano, keyboard guitar and
          ukulele lessons, after school art classes, lunchtime and after school dance & sport programs.</p>
